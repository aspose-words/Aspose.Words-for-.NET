        <p>
            When creating a project using this template, you should have named your project
            simply "ModuleName", not "Aspose.comModuleName". If you didn&#39;t do this, the
            easiest thing to do is close the solution, delete the folder from your DesktopModules
            folder, then create a new project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to limitations in the templating capabilities of Visual Studio, you will need
            to make some minor changes, and double check a few things, before you package this module.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Open up IIS Manager (start>run>INETMGR), go to your DNNDEV.ME website and make sure that DesktopModules is NOT a Virtual Directory/Application, if so, remove that.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>If you change the TARGET framework for the project, remove the WEB.CONFIG file that Visual Studio will add to your project.</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>BEFORE</strong> checking the
                module into your source control environment check the following.</li>
            <li>Edit the Project properties by double-clicking on the Properties folder in Solution
                Explorer</li>
            <li>On the Web tab:
                <ol>
                    <li>Under 'Start Action', make sure to set your Start URL to the correct site (ex: http://dnndev.me/).</li>
                    <li>Under 'Servers', make sure to "Use IIS Web Server" with a project url of http://dnndev.me/desktopmodules/AsposeDNNQuoteGenerator
                        and an Override application root URL of http://dnndev.me/</li>

        <h2>What is the use of Aspose .NET Products?</h2>

        <a href="http://www.aspose.com">Aspose</a> are file format experts and provide APIs and components for various file formats including MS Office, OpenOffice, PDF and Image formats. These APIs are available on a number of development platforms including .NET frameworks – the .NET frameworks starting from version 2.0 are supported. If you are a .NET developer, you can use Aspose’s native .NET APIs in your .NET applications to process various file formats in just a few lines of codes. All the Aspose APIs don’t have any dependency over any other engine. For example, you don’t need to have MS Office installed on the server to process MS Office files.

        <h2>Steps after your project is setup.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To Build and Package your Module you need to change to <b>Release</b> mode and then
                simply choose Build from the Build menu. The MSBuild scripts will do the packaging
                process for you. The packaging process creates an INSTALL and a SOURCE package in
                the INSTALL folder within your desktopmodule/modulename folder. </li>
            <li>Installing your module in your development DotNetNuke instance is easy.Take the
               <strong>INSTALL</strong> ZIP file that is created in the INSTALL folder, upload that using the Host/Extensions
                page, Installation Wizard. Using the INSTALL ZIP file will overwrite the files already in this folder, 
                but that shouldn't cause any problems as long as you install a recent build.</li>
            <li>After you've done a release for your module (typically deploying to an environment
                outside of your development environment) you should change the Version number, you
                need to do this in two places, the assemblyinfo file, and the .DNN manifest file.
                Next time you build the module in release mode you will get a new package (using
                the version number) created.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            After you are finished reading this Documentation you can delete the Documentation directory
            from your project.
